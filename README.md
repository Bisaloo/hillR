## Taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity and similarity through Hill Numbers

This package contains R functions to calculate diversity and similarity measures based on Chao, Chiu and Jost 2014 and Chiu & Chao 2014.

At this moment, only taxonomic and functional diversity and similarity were included.
